# guided-projects

This repository hosts some of the projects I made while studying the Data Analysis path on [Dataquest](https://app.dataquest.io/) during 2020:

- [Guided Project - Star Wars Survey](https://github.com/jaimebibiloni/guided-projects/commit/9be9e2adfdd16bef64ae9c7463e28b78439cf80e)

Although I wrote all the code, explanations, and conclusions, these projects were guided by Dataquest's learning platform, meaning that I executed conceptual instructions that led me to analyze different sets of data by using coding techniques I had previously learnt. 

The goals of the projects and the way of approaching each challenge did not steam from my own thinking but were given to me instead as a guide. As a result, **these projects are a good demonstration of my data analysis Python skills** but are not the best example of my holistic analysis capabilities.

All the data sets used in each project are also available in the repository.
