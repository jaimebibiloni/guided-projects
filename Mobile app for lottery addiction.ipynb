    "A medical institute has requested that we create the core logic for a new app aimed at improving user's understanding of the real probabilities involved in the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49), a kind of lottery popular in Canada which allows users to pick their playing numbers. By improving customer's understanding of the underlying probabilities, the institute hopes to decrease lottery addiction. Our task involves answering questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least five (or four, or three, or two) winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be analyzing a [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascienceai/lottery-dataset?resource=download) hosted in Kaggle which stores data on more than 3500 drawings between 1982 and 2018.\n",
    "\n",
